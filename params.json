{"name":"HDFS-CLI","body":"## HDFS-CLI\r\n\r\nHDFS-CLI is an interactive command line shell that makes interacting with the Hadoop Distribted Filesystem (HDFS)\r\nsimpler and more intuitive than the standard command-line tools that come with Hadoop. If you are familiar with OS X, Linux, or even Windows terminal/console-based applications, then you are likely familiar with features such as tab completion, command history, and ANSI formatting.\r\n\r\n### Basic Usage\r\nHDFS-CLI works much like a command-line ftp client: You first establish a connection to a remote HDFS filesystem,\r\nthen manage local/remote files and transfers.\r\n\r\nTo start HDFS-CLI, run the following command:\r\n\r\n\tjava -jar hdfs-cli-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar\r\n\r\n#### Local vs. Remote Commands\r\nWhen working within a HDFS-CLI session, you manage both local (on your computer) and remote (HDFS) files. By convention, commands that apply to both local and remote filesystems are differentiated by prepending an `l`\r\ncharacter to the name to denote \"local\".\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n`lls` lists local files in the local current working directory.\r\n\r\n`ls` lists remote files in the remote current working directory.\r\n\r\nEvery HDFS-CLI session keeps track of both the local and remote current working directories.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Available Commands\r\n\r\n#### Common Commands\r\n\tconnect\t\tconnect to a remote HDFS instance\r\n\thelp\t\tdisplay help information\r\n\tput\t\t\tupload local files to the remote HDFS\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Remote (HDFS) Commands\r\n\tcd\t\t change current working directory\r\n\tls\t\t list directory contents\r\n\trm\t\t delete files/directories\r\n\tpwd\t\t print working directory path\r\n\tcat\t\t print file contents\r\n\thead\t print first few lines of a file\r\n\tmkdir\t create directories\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Local (Local File System) Commands\r\n\tlcd\t\t change current working directory\r\n\tlls\t\t list directory contents\r\n\tlrm\t\t delete files/directories\r\n\tlpwd\t print working directory path\r\n\tlcat\t print file contents\r\n\tlhead\t print first few lines of a file\r\n\tlmkdir\t create directories\r\n\t\r\n### Command Documentation\r\nHelp for any command can be obtained by executing the `help` command:\r\n\r\n\thelp pwd\r\n\r\nNote that currently, documentation may be limited.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Known Bugs/Limitations\r\n\r\n* No support for paths containing spaces\r\n* No support for Windows XP\r\n\r\n\r\n","tagline":"Interactive shell for interacting with Hadoop HDFS.
